🚀 Next-Level Page Transitions with GSAP, SplitText & Lenis! 🎬

I've been experimenting with seamless page transitions, and here’s what I built:

✨ A smooth, cubic Bézier-powered animation where the previous page slides up while the next page smoothly enters from the bottom—creating a fluid and immersive transition.

⚡️ Tech Stack:
✔️ GSAP (GreenSock) for powerful animations
✔️ SplitText for dynamic text effects
✔️ Lenis for buttery-smooth scrolling
✔️ HTML, CSS, JavaScript for structure & styling

This effect is perfect for creative agencies, digital portfolios, and modern web experiences looking to add that extra finesse to their UI/UX.

💡 Would love to hear your thoughts! Let me know how you'd use this in your projects. Drop a comment or connect with me for more!
